       "'Title: Does certified organic farming reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production?\\nAbstract: The increasing prevalence of ecologically sustainable products in consumer markets, such as organic produce, are generally assumed to curtail anthropogenic impacts on the environment. Here I intend to present an alternative perspective on sustainable production by interpreting the relationship between recent rises in organic agriculture and greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production. I construct two time series fixed-effects panel regressions to estimate how increases in organic farmland impact greenhouse gas emissions derived from agricultural production. My analysis finds that the rise of certified organic production in the United States is not correlated with declines in greenhouse gas emissions derived specifically from agricultural production, and on the contrary is associated positively overall agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. To make sense of this finding, I embed my research within the conventionalization thesis. As a result I argue that the recent USDA certification of organic farming has generated a bifurcated organic market, where one form of organic farming works as a sustainable counterforce to conventional agriculture and the other works to increase the economic accessibility of organic farming through weakening practice standards most conducive to reducing agricultural greenhouse gas output. Additionally, I construct my own theoretical framework known as the displacement paradox to further interpret my findings.\\nBased on the abstract/title, Is the abstract INCLUDE or EXCLUDE in our literature review?

    "        \"Cropping is responsible for substantial emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHGs) worldwide through the use of fertilizers and through expansion of agricultural land and associated carbon losses. Especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), GHG emissions from these processes might increase steeply in coming decades, due to tripling demand for food until 2050 to match the steep population growth. This study assesses the impact of achieving cereal self-sufficiency by the year 2050 for 10 SSA countries on GHG emissions related to different scenarios of increasing cereal production, ranging from intensifying production to agricultural area expansion. We also assessed different nutrient management variants in the intensification. Our analysis revealed that irrespective of intensification or extensification, GHG emissions of the 10 countries jointly are at least 50% higher in 2050 than in 2015. Intensification will come, depending on the nutrient use efficiency achieved, with large increases in nutrient inputs and associated GHG emissions. However, matching food demand through conversion of forest and grasslands to cereal area likely results in much higher GHG emissions. Moreover, many countries lack enough suitable land for cereal expansion to match food demand. In addition, we analysed the uncertainty in our GHG estimates and found that it is caused primarily by uncertainty in the IPCC Tier 1 coefficient for direct N2O emissions, and by the agronomic nitrogen use efficiency (N-AE). In conclusion, intensification scenarios are clearly superior to expansion scenarios in terms of climate change mitigation, but only if current N-AE is increased to levels commonly achieved in, for example, the United States, and which have been demonstrated to be feasible in some locations in SSA. As such, intensifying cereal production with good agronomy and nutrient management is essential to moderate inevitable increases in GHG emissions. Sustainably increasing crop production in SSA is therefore a daunting challenge in the coming decades.\"), \n",

    "        \"Paddy rice cultivation is an important source of global anthropogenic methane emissions. Drainage the flooded soils can reduce methane substantially, but N2O emission occur concurrently, which would offset the reduction of methane emission. It remains unclear how mid-season drainage affects the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 and N2O emissions. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of mid-season drainage on GWP and the factors that control the response of GWP to mid-season drainage. Results showed that mid-season drainage decreased CH4 emission by 52% while increased N2O emission by 242%. The GWP under mid-season drainage decreased by 47% compared to continuously flooding. The yield-scaled GWP under mid-season drainage decreased by 48%. Mid-season drainage had no effect on rice grain yield. Although soil drainage times and organic matter amendment are important factors affecting CH4 and N2O emissions in rice paddy field, the study showed that neither of them had effect on the response of GWP to mid-season drainage. The reduction rate of the GWP under mid-season drainage increased when N fertilization application rate increases from 50 kg ha(-1) to > 200 kg ha(-1). This study demonstrated that CH4 is still a dominant greenhouse gas in rice paddies under water management with mid-season drainage. Nitrogen fertilization is an important factor that regulates the response of GWP to mid-season drainage. High nitrogen fertilization rate would decrease the overall emission of CH4 and N2O under mid-season drainage. However, increasing drainage times or applying organic fertilizer under mid-season does not change the overall emission rate of CH4 and N2O.\"), \n",

We adjusted the scenarios by replacing 25% and 50% of nitrogen chemical fertilizer with respective amounts of N-based organic fertilizer (S2 and S3). Face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect primary data. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology with the cradle to gate approach was used to estimate GHG emission based on the functional unit of one hectare of growing area and one tonnage of fresh fruit weight. The emission factors of agrochemicals, fertilizers, electricity, fuel production, and internal combustion were collected from the MiLCA software, IPCC reports, and previous studies. The S1, S2, and S3 emissions were 7590, 6703, and 5884 kg-CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e) per hectare of the growing area and 273.6, 240.3, and 209.7 kg-CO(2)e for each tonnage of commercial fruit, respectively. Changing fertilizer-based practice from S1 to S2 and S3 mitigated 887.0-1706 kg-CO(2)e ha(-1) (11.7-22.5%) and 33.3-63.9 kg-CO(2)e t(-1) (12.2-25.6%), respectively.

However, the effects of the combination of long-term NT systems and cover crops on non-carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and SOC sequestration have not been adequately documented, particularly in East Asia. We conducted a split-plot field experiment involving two tillage systems [NT and moldboard plowing (MP)] and three cover crops, namely, fallow (FA), hairy vetch (HV), and rye (RY). NT had slightly higher soybean yield than MP, although tillage methods and cover crop treatments had no significant effects on soybean yield. Cover crop treatments rather than tillage methods significantly affected methane (CH4) emissions; under FA and RY treatments, we observed CH4 uptakes, whereas under HV, we observed CH4 emissions. In contrast, rather than cover crop treatments, tillage methods affected nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Higher WFPS and soil bulk density under NT resulted in significantly higher annual N2O emissions than those under MP. However, under NT, the annual SOC sequestration rate significantly increased compared with that under MP, the global warming potential (GWP) caused by CH4 and N2O emissions was fully offset by net CO2 retention under NT. Additionally, treatment under NT reduced net GWP and yield-scaled GWP to a significantly greater degree than did treatment under MP. Treatments under NT with RY cover crop had the lowest net GWP (-2324 kg CO2 equivalent ha(-1) year(-1)) and yield-scaled GWP (-1037 kg CO2 equivalent Mg-1 soybean yield). These findings suggest that treatments under NT with cover crop systems-especially RY cover crop-in the long-term organic soybean field maintains sustainable crop production and reduces net GWP and yield-scaled GWP, which will be an effective climate-smart agriculture practice in the humid, subtropical regions prevailing in Kanto, Japan.\"), \n",

       "('Title: Improving nitrogen management via a regional management plan for Chinese rice production\\nAbstract: A lack of basic information on optimal nitrogen (N) management often results in over-or under-application of N fertilizer in small-scale intensive rice farming. Here, we present a new database of N input from a survey of 6611 small-scale rice farmers and rice yield in response to added N in 1177 experimental on-farm tests across eight agroecological subregions of China. This database enables us to evaluate N management by farmers and develop an optimal approach to regional N management. We also investigated grain yield, N application rate, and estimated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in comparison to N application and farming practices. Across all farmers, the average N application rate, weighted by the area of rice production in each subregion, was 210 kg ha(-1) and ranged from 30 to 744 kg ha(-1) across fields and from 131 to 316 kg ha(-1) across regions. The regionally optimal N rate (RONR) determined from the experiments averaged 167 kg ha(-1) and varied from 114 to 224 kg N ha(-1) for the different regions. If these RONR were widely adopted in China, approximately 56% of farms would reduce their use of N fertilizer, and approximately 33% would increase their use of N fertilizer. As a result, grain yield would increase by 7.4% from 7.14 to 7.67 Mg ha(-1), and the estimated GHG emissions would be reduced by 11.1% from 1390 to 1236 kg carbon dioxide (CO2) eq Mg-1 grain. These results suggest that to achieve the goals of improvement in regional yield and sustainable environmental development, regional N use should be optimized among N-poor and N-rich farms and regions in China.\\nBased on the abstract/title, Is the abstract INCLUDE or EXCLUDE in our literature review?
