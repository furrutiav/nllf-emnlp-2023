       "'Title: Does certified organic farming reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production?\\nAbstract: The increasing prevalence of ecologically sustainable products in consumer markets, such as organic produce, are generally assumed to curtail anthropogenic impacts on the environment. Here I intend to present an alternative perspective on sustainable production by interpreting the relationship between recent rises in organic agriculture and greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production. I construct two time series fixed-effects panel regressions to estimate how increases in organic farmland impact greenhouse gas emissions derived from agricultural production. My analysis finds that the rise of certified organic production in the United States is not correlated with declines in greenhouse gas emissions derived specifically from agricultural production, and on the contrary is associated positively overall agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. To make sense of this finding, I embed my research within the conventionalization thesis. As a result I argue that the recent USDA certification of organic farming has generated a bifurcated organic market, where one form of organic farming works as a sustainable counterforce to conventional agriculture and the other works to increase the economic accessibility of organic farming through weakening practice standards most conducive to reducing agricultural greenhouse gas output. Additionally, I construct my own theoretical framework known as the displacement paradox to further interpret my findings.\\nBased on the abstract/title, Is the abstract INCLUDE or EXCLUDE in our literature review?'"

    "        \"Cropping is responsible for substantial emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHGs) worldwide through the use of fertilizers and through expansion of agricultural land and associated carbon losses. Especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), GHG emissions from these processes might increase steeply in coming decades, due to tripling demand for food until 2050 to match the steep population growth. This study assesses the impact of achieving cereal self-sufficiency by the year 2050 for 10 SSA countries on GHG emissions related to different scenarios of increasing cereal production, ranging from intensifying production to agricultural area expansion. We also assessed different nutrient management variants in the intensification. Our analysis revealed that irrespective of intensification or extensification, GHG emissions of the 10 countries jointly are at least 50% higher in 2050 than in 2015. Intensification will come, depending on the nutrient use efficiency achieved, with large increases in nutrient inputs and associated GHG emissions. However, matching food demand through conversion of forest and grasslands to cereal area likely results in much higher GHG emissions. Moreover, many countries lack enough suitable land for cereal expansion to match food demand. In addition, we analysed the uncertainty in our GHG estimates and found that it is caused primarily by uncertainty in the IPCC Tier 1 coefficient for direct N2O emissions, and by the agronomic nitrogen use efficiency (N-AE). In conclusion, intensification scenarios are clearly superior to expansion scenarios in terms of climate change mitigation, but only if current N-AE is increased to levels commonly achieved in, for example, the United States, and which have been demonstrated to be feasible in some locations in SSA. As such, intensifying cereal production with good agronomy and nutrient management is essential to moderate inevitable increases in GHG emissions. Sustainably increasing crop production in SSA is therefore a daunting challenge in the coming decades.\"), \n",

Drainage the flooded soils can reduce methane substantially, but N2O emission occur concurrently, which would offset the reduction of methane emission. It remains unclear how mid-season drainage affects the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 and N2O emissions. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of mid-season drainage on GWP and the factors that control the response of GWP to mid-season drainage. Results showed that mid-season drainage decreased CH4 emission by 52% while increased N2O emission by 242%. The GWP under mid-season drainage decreased by 47% compared to continuously flooding. The yield-scaled GWP under mid-season drainage decreased by 48%. Mid-season drainage had no effect on rice grain yield. Although soil drainage times and organic matter amendment are important factors affecting CH4 and N2O emissions in rice paddy field, the study showed that neither of them had effect on the response of GWP to mid-season drainage. The reduction rate of the GWP under mid-season drainage increased when N fertilization application rate increases from 50 kg ha(-1) to > 200 kg ha(-1). This study demonstrated that CH4 is still a dominant greenhouse gas in rice paddies under water management with mid-season drainage. Nitrogen fertilization is an important factor that regulates the response of GWP to mid-season drainage. High nitrogen fertilization rate would decrease the overall emission of CH4 and N2O under mid-season drainage. However, increasing drainage times or applying organic fertilizer under mid-season does not change the overall emission rate of CH4 and N2O.\"), \n",

Face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect primary data. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology with the cradle to gate approach was used to estimate GHG emission based on the functional unit of one hectare of growing area and one tonnage of fresh fruit weight.

However, the effects of the combination of long-term NT systems and cover crops on non-carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and SOC sequestration have not been adequately documented, particularly in East Asia. We conducted a split-plot field experiment involving two tillage systems [NT and moldboard plowing (MP)] and three cover crops, namely, fallow (FA), hairy vetch (HV), and rye (RY). NT had slightly higher soybean yield than MP, although tillage methods and cover crop treatments had no significant effects on soybean yield. Cover crop treatments rather than tillage methods significantly affected methane (CH4) emissions; under FA and RY treatments, we observed CH4 uptakes, whereas under HV, we observed CH4 emissions. In contrast, rather than cover crop treatments, tillage methods affected nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Higher WFPS and soil bulk density under NT resulted in significantly higher annual N2O emissions than those under MP. However, under NT, the annual SOC sequestration rate significantly increased compared with that under MP, the global warming potential (GWP) caused by CH4 and N2O emissions was fully offset by net CO2 retention under NT. Additionally, treatment under NT reduced net GWP and yield-scaled GWP to a significantly greater degree than did treatment under MP. Treatments under NT with RY cover crop had the lowest net GWP (-2324 kg CO2 equivalent ha(-1) year(-1)) and yield-scaled GWP (-1037 kg CO2 equivalent Mg-1 soybean yield). These findings suggest that treatments under NT with cover crop systems-especially RY cover crop-in the long-term organic soybean field maintains sustainable crop production and reduces net GWP and yield-scaled GWP, which will be an effective climate-smart agriculture practice in the humid, subtropical regions prevailing in Kanto, Japan.\"), \n",

       "('Title: Double cropping and manure management mitigate the environmental impact of a dairy farm under present and future climate\\nAbstract: CONTEXT: Strategies are needed to reduce the environmental impacts of dairy farms, and these may become more important as our climate continues to change. Double cropping small grain and corn silages provides a strategy that can benefit dairy farms in the northeastern U.S. as they adapt to a longer growing season. Subsurface application of manure may also reduce nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses as the region faces warmer temperatures and greater precipitation. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate whole-farm production, environmental and economic impacts of adopting these strategies on a representative dairy farm in central Pennsylvania under recent historical and projected midcentury climate. METHODS: Farm management strategies were simulated using the Integrated Farm System Model to determine effects on crop yields, feed production, volatile, leaching and denitrification losses of N, sediment erosion, sediment-bound and soluble losses of P, farm-gate life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, fossil energy use, and production costs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Double cropping increased and stabilized feed production by providing forage from a winter rye crop with less dependency on the summer crops of corn silage and perennial grasses. Summer crops are susceptible to summer droughts, which are expected to increase in this region due to warmer tem-peratures and increased evapotranspiration. Double cropping was more beneficial in the midcentury climate due to the projected increase in growing season length. Double cropping and subsurface injection of manure reduced total N losses by 12-18% and total P losses by 16-19%. Double cropping using broadcast manure application had a neutral environmental and economic impact on the farm. Adoption of these strategies provided a feasible adaptation and mitigation approach for future climate by reducing projected increases in soluble P runoff and ammonia emission caused by warmer temperatures and greater precipitation while maintaining and potentially reducing total farm production costs. SIGNIFICANCE: Whole-farm simulation provides a tool for evaluating potential benefits and tradeoffs of novel technologies and strategies as agriculture adapts to changes in climate. Although these results are specific to a dairy farm in central Pennsylvania, they generally apply to dairy farms throughout the Northeast U.S. and cli-mates where similar changes in temperature and precipitation are projected by mid-century. Our analyses suggest that use of a more intensive crop rotation (double cropping winter small grain and corn silage) along with improved manure application technology (subsurface injection) can help mitigate dairy farm environmental impacts now and even more in the future.\\nBased on the abstract/title, Is the abstract INCLUDE or EXCLUDE in our literature review?',\n",
