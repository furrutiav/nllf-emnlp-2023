       "'Title: Does certified organic farming reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production?\\nAbstract: The increasing prevalence of ecologically sustainable products in consumer markets, such as organic produce, are generally assumed to curtail anthropogenic impacts on the environment. Here I intend to present an alternative perspective on sustainable production by interpreting the relationship between recent rises in organic agriculture and greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production. I construct two time series fixed-effects panel regressions to estimate how increases in organic farmland impact greenhouse gas emissions derived from agricultural production. My analysis finds that the rise of certified organic production in the United States is not correlated with declines in greenhouse gas emissions derived specifically from agricultural production, and on the contrary is associated positively overall agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. To make sense of this finding, I embed my research within the conventionalization thesis. As a result I argue that the recent USDA certification of organic farming has generated a bifurcated organic market, where one form of organic farming works as a sustainable counterforce to conventional agriculture and the other works to increase the economic accessibility of organic farming through weakening practice standards most conducive to reducing agricultural greenhouse gas output. Additionally, I construct my own theoretical framework known as the displacement paradox to further interpret my findings.\\nBased on the abstract/title, Is the abstract INCLUDE or EXCLUDE in our literature review?

       "(\"Title: Importance of Soils of Agroecosystems for Climate Change Policy\\nAbstract: Until now, international climate change policy has neglected the potential of agroecosystems to contribute to climate change mitigation by reduction in net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and by enhancing soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration. Proven agricultural practices for creating a positive soil C balance such as those under the umbrella of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) are readily available. In the future, the importance of soil C stocks for climate change mitigation will be addressed by the target of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) of United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and land- and soil-related targets for achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Further, many nationally determined contributions (NDCs) submitted to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) after the 2015 Paris Agreement include references to soil enhancement and to the necessity of better soil management practices. Similarly, an ambitious goal to increase global soil C stocks of managed agricultural land by 0.4% per year in the topsoil was set by the '4 Per 1000 Initiative: Soils for Food Security and Climate' (4p1000). Based on this, spatially diversified strategies need to be developed to sequester SOC in agroecosystems by addressing limitations imposed by nutrient (i.e., nitrogen and phosphorus) availability, and due consideration of economic and social aspects. Thus, meaningful actions that help to restore and protect soils of agroecosystems including their SOC stocks have been initiated recently. It is hoped that soils of agroecosystems will increasingly be managed to address climate climate change while at the same time contributing to food security under increasing pressure from population growth and dietary changes. This chapter begins with an overview over some practices to enhance soil C stocks in agroecosystems for climate and food security. This is followed by a description of previously proposed climate change mitigation policies and their reference to agroecosystems soil C stocks. Then, a brief overview over CSA, carbon farming, and the soil security framework is given. This chapter concludes with a section on payments for ecosystem services (ESs).\\nBased on the abstract/title, Is the abstract INCLUDE or EXCLUDE in our literature review? Think step by step.\",\n",
