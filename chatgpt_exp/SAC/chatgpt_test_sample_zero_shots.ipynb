       "'Title: Does certified organic farming reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production?\\nAbstract: The increasing prevalence of ecologically sustainable products in consumer markets, such as organic produce, are generally assumed to curtail anthropogenic impacts on the environment. Here I intend to present an alternative perspective on sustainable production by interpreting the relationship between recent rises in organic agriculture and greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production. I construct two time series fixed-effects panel regressions to estimate how increases in organic farmland impact greenhouse gas emissions derived from agricultural production. My analysis finds that the rise of certified organic production in the United States is not correlated with declines in greenhouse gas emissions derived specifically from agricultural production, and on the contrary is associated positively overall agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. To make sense of this finding, I embed my research within the conventionalization thesis. As a result I argue that the recent USDA certification of organic farming has generated a bifurcated organic market, where one form of organic farming works as a sustainable counterforce to conventional agriculture and the other works to increase the economic accessibility of organic farming through weakening practice standards most conducive to reducing agricultural greenhouse gas output. Additionally, I construct my own theoretical framework known as the displacement paradox to further interpret my findings.\\nBased on the abstract/title, Is the abstract INCLUDE or EXCLUDE in our literature review?

       "('Title: Influence of conservation tillage on Greenhouse gas fluxes and crop productivity in spring-wheat agroecosystems on the Loess Plateau of China\\nAbstract: The effects of climate change such as dry spells, floods and erosion heavily impact agriculture especially smallholder systems on the Northwestern Loess Plateau of China. Nonetheless agriculture also contributes to global warming through the emission of greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4 and N2O. Yet this complex conundrum can be alleviated and mitigated through sound soil and water management practices. Despite considerable literature on Conservation Agriculture (CA) as a strategy to improve the resilience and mitigation capacity of agroecosystems, there is still paucity of information on the impacts of CA on crop production and environmental quality on the Plateau. In order to fill this gap this study examined the effects of no-till and straw mulch on crop productivity and greenhouse gas fluxes in agroecosystems on the Plateau where farmers\\' common practice of conventional tillage (CT) was tested against three CA practices: conventional tillage with straw mulch (CTS), no-till (NT) and no-till with straw mulch (NTS). The results indicated that all three CA practices (CTS, NTand NTS) markedly increased soil water content (SWC), soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) but reduced soil temperature (ST). Average grain yields were 854.46 +/- 76.51, 699.30 +/- 133.52 and 908.18 +/- 38.64 kg ha-1 respectively under CTS, NT and NTS indicating an increase by approximately 33%, 9% and 41% respectively compared with CT (644.61 +/- 76.98 kg ha(-1)). There were significant (p < 0 :05) reductions of Net CO2 emissions under NT (7.37 +/- 0.89 tCO2e ha(-1)y(-1)) and NTS (6.65 +/- 0.73 tCO2e ha(-1)y(-1)) compared with CTS (10.65 +/- 0.18 tCO2e ha(-1)y(-1)) and CT (11.14 +/- 0.58 tCO2e ha(-1)y(-1)). All the treatments served as sinks of CH4but NTS had the highest absorption capacity (0.27 +/- 0.024 tCO2e ha(-1)y(-1)) and increased absorption significantly (p< 0 :05) compared with CT (0.21 +/- 0.017 tCO2e ha(-1)y(-1)); however, CA did not reduce emissions of N2O. These had an influence on Global warming potential (GWP) as NT and NTS resulted in significant reduction in net GWP. Grain yield was significantly correlated positively with SOC and STN (p< 0 :05); ecosystem respiration was also significantly correlated withSWCand ST whileCH(4) flux was highly correlated with ST (p< 0:001). Crop yield and GHG responses to CA were controlled by soil hydrothermal and nutrient changes, thus improving these conditions through adoption of sustainable soil moisture improvement practices such as no-till, straw mulch, green manuring, contour ploughing and terracing can improve crop resilience to climate change and reduce GHG emissions in arid and semi-arid regions.\\nBased on the abstract/title, Is the abstract INCLUDE or EXCLUDE in our literature review?
